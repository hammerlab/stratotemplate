## Template for Configuring Stratocumulus' `gcpketrew.sh`

## You need to choose a prefix for all the names generated by the script and
## Google tools:
## - This name will show up in the WebUIs of Google-cloud
## - Don't use more than 15 characters because GCE has some limitations on
##   names' lengths
## Cf. also <https://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-sdk/issues/detail?id=336>

# export PREFIX=improbability-drive

## Choose an authentication token for the Ketrew server:

# echo export TOKEN=some-big-string-12387387438

## The script will output the server's SSH configuration and Key pairs there:
## You don't have to change this if you follow the tutorial.

export SSH_CONFIG_DIR=$PWD/_sshconfig/
