## Template for Configuring Stratocumulus' scripts



## You need to choose a prefix for all the names generated by the scripts and
## Google tools:
## - This name will show up in the WebUIs of Google-cloud
## - Don't use more than 15 characters because GCE has some limitations on
##   names' lengths

# export PREFIX=improbability-drive


## Choose an authentication token for the Ketrew server:

# echo export TOKEN=some-big-string-12387387438


## The `gcpketrew.sh` script will output the server's SSH configuration and Key
## pairs there:
## You don't have to change this if you follow the tutorial.

export SSH_CONFIG_DIR=$PWD/_sshconfig/


## The `gcloud`-enabled host, from the Ketrew server's perspective.
## On a google-cloud VM used as `gclouder` (like in the Instructions),
## Look at the result of the commands `whoami` and `hostname` to fill the gaps:

# export GCLOUD_HOST="ssh://<googleusername>@<gclouder-vm-name>/tmp/KT-dir"

## Numer of compute nodes in the deployed cluster:

# export CLUSTER_NODES=12




## `$KETREW_URL` tells `gcpketrew.sh` to output the URL of the server to that
## file
## If you use
##      ketrew init --conf ./ketrewdocker/ --just-client $(cat $KETREW_URL)
## then `$KETREW_CONFIGURATION` will be already set correctly:

export KETREW_URL=$PWD/ketrew-url
export KETREW_CONFIGURATION=$PWD//ketrewdocker/configuration.ml
