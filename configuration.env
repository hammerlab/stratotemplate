## Template for Configuring Stratocumulus'


## Used by:
## - `gcpketrew.sh`: PREFIX, TOKEN, SSH_CONFIG_DIR
## - `cluster.ml`: PREFIX, CLUSTER_NODES

## You need to choose a prefix for all the names generated by the scripts and
## Google tools:
## - This name will show up in the WebUIs of Google-cloud
## - Don't use more than 15 characters because GCE has some limitations on
##   names' lengths

# export PREFIX=improbability-drive

## Choose an authentication token for the Ketrew server:

# echo export TOKEN=some-big-string-12387387438

## The script will output the server's SSH configuration and Key pairs there:
## You don't have to change this if you follow the tutorial.

export SSH_CONFIG_DIR=$PWD/_sshconfig/
